# 4th Year Distributed Systems Project

You are required to use the JAX-RS/Jersey, Java RMI and JAXB frameworks to develop a simple Car Hire Booking System. A Web Client page should provide users with the ability to Create/Modify/Update/Delete bookings for a specific vehicle for a given set of dates. The Web Client will interact with a RESTful JAX-RS Web Service for bookings which is deployed on Apache Tomcat Server. The RESTful Web Service will act as an RMI client to an RMI Database Server which will handle persistence.
